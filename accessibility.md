# Accessibility Testing
  
## Wave Test 
  
The first accessibility test I used was the wave accessibility test.  
I had a few alerts about redundant links and skipped heading levels, and the only error was an empty link, coming from my mobile hamburger menu, which was of no concern.

## Responsiveness  
  
The next test was done to ensure responsiveness, and the site was fully functional on all mainstream devices.  
Everything looked fine here as well.

## Browser Support  
  
The project was tested on some of the more common browsers, to ensure everything worked as intended.  
This is the list of browsers I tested on, and some small notes on the results:  
  
[Opera](https://www.opera.com): Everything loaded fine without any issues  
[Opera GX](https://www.opera.com/gx): Everything loaded fine without any issues  
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome): Everything loaded fine without any issues  
[Microsoft Edge](www.microsoft.com/edge): Edge was struggling slightly from time to time with somewhat longer loading times, but once the page was loaded and cached, everything went very smoothly.  
[Brave](https://brave.com): Everything loaded fine without any issues
